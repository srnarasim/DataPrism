# DataPrism Repository Protection Strategy - PRP

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** DataPrism Repository Protection Strategy Implementation  
**Project Code:** DRPS-2025-001  
**Project Type:** Security Infrastructure  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Owner:** Security Team  
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, DevOps, Repository Maintainers

## Executive Summary

This PRP outlines the implementation of a comprehensive GitHub repository protection strategy for DataPrism Core using GitHub's advanced rulesets feature. The strategy addresses critical security concerns for a WebAssembly-powered analytics engine, including protection against unauthorized changes, sensitive data exposure, and build artifact corruption.

## Business Justification

### Current State
- Repository has basic branch protection on main branch
- Limited protection against sensitive file commits
- No enforcement of WebAssembly file size limits
- Manual review process for security-sensitive changes
- Inconsistent development workflow across contributors

### Desired State
- Multi-layered repository protection using GitHub rulesets
- Automated prevention of sensitive data commits
- Enforced WebAssembly file size constraints (6MB limit)
- Streamlined development workflow with security guardrails
- Comprehensive audit trail for all repository changes

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk:** Accidental secrets/credentials commit → Push protection rules
- **Medium Risk:** Oversized WASM files affecting performance → File size enforcement
- **Medium Risk:** Unauthorized main branch modifications → PR review requirements
- **Low Risk:** Inconsistent code quality → Automated status checks
