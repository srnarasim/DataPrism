# DataPrism CDN Deployment PRP Template

This Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) template defines the requirements for deploying DataPrism Core and its plugin ecosystem to a CDN, with an initial focus on GitHub Pages and extensibility for other CDN providers.

---

## 1. Objective

Enable seamless, secure, and performant deployment of DataPrism Core (WASM engine, JS/TS orchestration, plugins) to GitHub Pages as a static CDN. Ensure the deployment process and artifact structure are designed for future compatibility with additional CDN providers (e.g., Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

---

## 2. Scope

- Static asset deployment of DataPrism Core, plugin framework, and plugins to GitHub Pages.
- WASM asset handling, MIME configuration, and cache optimization.
- Plugin discovery and dynamic loading support.
- CDN-agnostic build and deployment scripts.
- Documentation for extending deployment to other CDN platforms.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Static Asset Packaging**
  - Bundle all JS/TS, WASM, and plugin assets into a `dist/` directory.
  - WASM binaries must be included and referenced with correct relative paths.
  - Output directory structure must be compatible with GitHub Pages and other static CDNs.

- **MIME Type Configuration**
  - Ensure `.wasm` files are served with `application/wasm` MIME type.
  - Provide documentation for setting custom MIME types on other CDNs if needed.

- **Plugin Loading**
  - Plugins must be discoverable and loadable at runtime via manifest files.
  - Support for dynamic plugin loading via relative or absolute URLs.
  - All plugin assets must be cacheable and versioned.

- **Cache Control**
  - Set cache-control headers for long-lived static assets (WASM, JS, plugins).
  - Provide mechanisms for cache busting using versioned file names or query strings.

- **CDN-Agnostic Deployment Scripts**
  - Provide build and deploy scripts for GitHub Pages (`gh-pages`), with abstraction to support Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, and Vercel.
  - Scripts must allow easy switching of deployment targets via configuration.

- **Security**
  - WASM integrity checks (e.g., Subresource Integrity or hash validation).
  - Content Security Policy guidance for safe WASM execution.
  - HTTPS enforced for all asset delivery.

- **Documentation**
  - Step-by-step guide for deploying to GitHub Pages.
  - Extension guide for deploying to other CDNs.
  - Troubleshooting and FAQ for common CDN issues.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
  - Initial load (including WASM) in <5 seconds on modern broadband.
  - Plugin loading should add <1 second per plugin.
  - Brotli and gzip compression enabled where supported.

- **Browser Compatibility**
  - Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+.
  - WASM support validated at runtime with fallback/error messaging.

- **Scalability**
  - Support for large datasets and multiple plugins without CDN-specific bottlenecks.
  - CDN edge caching for global performance.

- **Extensibility**
  - Modular build/deploy pipeline to add new CDN targets with minimal changes.
  - Clear abstraction of CDN-specific vs. CDN-agnostic logic.

---

## 5. Quality Assurance

- Automated build verification for all deployment targets.
- WASM and JS asset integrity tests post-deployment.
- Plugin manifest validation and dynamic loading tests.
- Manual and automated browser compatibility testing.
- Load and performance testing for large data and plugin scenarios.

---

## 6. Deliverables

- `dist/` directory with all static assets ready for CDN deployment.
- Deployment scripts for GitHub Pages and templates for other CDNs.
- Documentation covering deployment, configuration, and CDN extension.
- Example `gh-pages` workflow for GitHub Actions CI/CD.
- Test suite for asset integrity and runtime plugin loading.

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- DataPrism Core and at least three plugins are deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages.
- WASM engine loads and runs in all target browsers from the CDN.
- Plugins can be dynamically loaded and registered at runtime.
- Switching deployment to another CDN requires only configuration changes, not code rewrites.
- Documentation enables new users to deploy DataPrism to GitHub Pages or another CDN in under 30 minutes.
