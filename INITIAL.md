# DataPrism Core - Initial Feature Request Template

## FEATURE:
[Describe the specific feature you want to implement. Be detailed about functionality, performance requirements, and integration points with existing architecture.]

Example:
- Implement WebAssembly memory management system for DuckDB integration
- Add TypeScript API for LLM query processing with caching
- Create plugin system for extending analytics capabilities
- Implement Arrow-based data serialization between WASM and JavaScript

## ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT:
[Explain how this feature fits into the overall DataPrism Core architecture. Consider the hybrid design with WASM core and JavaScript orchestration.]

Example:
- This feature operates in the Core WASM Engine layer
- Requires coordination between Rust WASM module and TypeScript orchestration
- Uses DuckDB-WASM for data processing
- Integrates with LLM providers through abstraction layer

## EXAMPLES:
[Reference specific files in the examples/ directory that demonstrate patterns to follow. Include explanations of what aspects should be mimicked.]

Example:
- See `examples/wasm-js-interop.rs` for proper wasm-bindgen usage patterns
- Follow `examples/duckdb-integration.ts` for database connection management
- Use `examples/llm-provider.ts` for LLM integration patterns
- Reference `examples/error-handling.rs` for cross-language error handling

## DOCUMENTATION:
[Include links to relevant documentation, APIs, specifications, and resources needed for implementation.]

Example:
- WebAssembly specification: https://webassembly.org/docs/
- DuckDB-WASM documentation: https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm
- wasm-bindgen guide: https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/
- Arrow format specification: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/
- LLM API documentation (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
[Specify performance targets and constraints for this feature.]

Example:
- Query response time: <2 seconds for 95% of operations
- Memory usage: Stay within 4GB browser limit for 1M row datasets
- Initialization time: <5 seconds for engine startup
- API latency: <100ms for most operations

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
[Outline testing strategies and requirements for this feature.]

Example:
- Unit tests for all public APIs (Rust and TypeScript)
- Integration tests for WASM-JavaScript interactions
- Performance benchmarks for core operations
- Browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Memory leak detection and stress testing

## BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
[Specify browser support requirements and considerations.]

Example:
- Target: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- WebAssembly MVP specification compliance required
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features
- Graceful degradation for older browser versions

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
[Outline security requirements and potential vulnerabilities to address.]

Example:
- Input validation for all external data
- Content Security Policy compliance
- Secure handling of sensitive data in memory
- Protection against injection attacks
- Rate limiting for LLM API calls

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
[Mention gotchas, edge cases, integration challenges, or things AI assistants commonly miss.]

Example:
- WebAssembly memory model limitations (32-bit address space)
- JavaScript-WASM boundary serialization overhead
- Browser memory pressure handling
- DuckDB connection lifecycle management
- LLM context window limitations
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for remote data access
- Mobile browser performance constraints

## INTEGRATION POINTS:
[Describe how this feature integrates with existing components.]

Example:
- Integrates with existing DuckDB connection pool
- Uses shared memory management system
- Leverages existing error handling patterns
- Connects to LLM abstraction layer
- Utilizes plugin system architecture

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
[Define what successful implementation looks like.]

Example:
- All tests pass (unit, integration, performance)
- Performance targets met consistently
- Browser compatibility verified
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Code review approval
- Memory usage within acceptable limits
- API design follows established patterns

## DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
[Consider how this feature affects deployment and distribution.]

Example:
- WASM bundle size impact
- Build time implications
- CDN distribution considerations
- Caching strategy effects
- Version compatibility requirements
