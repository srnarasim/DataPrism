# DataPrism Core Packaging PRP Template

This Markdown file provides a Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) template for specifying packaging and distribution requirements for DataPrism Core, its plugin framework, and out-of-the-box plugins. It also includes a sample demo app scenario, illustrating end-to-end usage of the packaged components.

---

## 1. Packaging PRP Template

### Section 1: Objective

Define a robust, developer-friendly packaging and distribution strategy for DataPrism Core, its extensibility framework, and a suite of out-of-the-box plugins. Ensure seamless integration, versioning, and demonstration of an end-to-end use case via a sample demo application.

### Section 2: Scope

- Packaging and distribution of:
  - DataPrism Core (WASM engine + JS/TS orchestration)
  - Plugin framework (interfaces, loader, SDK)
  - Out-of-the-box plugins (visualization, data integration, LLM, utility)
- Support for npm, CDN, and direct download
- Documentation and demo application

### Section 3: Functional Requirements

- **Modular Packaging**
  - Publish core, framework, and plugins as independent npm packages
  - Provide ES module and UMD builds
  - Support tree-shaking and minimal bundle sizes

- **WASM Asset Handling**
  - Include WASM binaries in core and relevant plugin packages
  - Async WASM loading with integrity checks

- **Plugin Discovery & Registration**
  - Manifest-based plugin registration
  - CLI tools for scaffolding and validation

- **Versioning & Compatibility**
  - Semantic versioning across all packages
  - Compatibility matrix documentation

- **Documentation**
  - Unified docs portal for all packages
  - API references and integration guides

- **Security**
  - WASM binary signing and verification
  - Manifest validation and sandboxing

- **Demo Application**
  - Example app consuming all packages
  - Demonstrates core, plugin framework, and at least three plugins in an end-to-end workflow

### Section 4: Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
  - Core bundle (including WASM) loads in <5 seconds on modern browsers
  - Plugin loading adds <1 second per plugin

- **Browser Compatibility**
  - Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

- **Developer Experience**
  - One-command setup for demo app
  - Hot-reloading for plugin development

- **Distribution**
  - CDN fallback for WASM and plugins
  - Versioned releases with changelogs

### Section 5: Quality Assurance

- Automated integration tests for all packages
- Demo app E2E tests covering core workflows
- WASM integrity and compatibility checks
- Plugin manifest validation tests

### Section 6: Deliverables

- npm packages: `@prism/core`, `@prism/plugin-framework`, `@prism/plugins-*`
- CDN bundle for browser use
- Comprehensive documentation site
- Demo application (see below)
- CLI tools for plugin management

### Section 7: Success Criteria

- Developers can install and initialize core, framework, and plugins via npm in <10 minutes
- Demo app runs an end-to-end analytics workflow using at least three plugins
- All packages pass integration and compatibility tests across target browsers
- Documentation enables new users to replicate demo app setup without external support

## 2. Sample Demo App Specification

### Objective

Demonstrate an end-to-end workflow using DataPrism Core, the plugin framework, and out-of-the-box plugins in a browser-based analytics scenario.

### Demo App Features

- **Data Import**: Use the CSV Importer plugin to upload a large CSV file (>100k rows)
- **Data Processing**: Core WASM engine processes and indexes the data
- **Visualization**: Observable Charts plugin renders interactive histograms and scatter plots
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI plugin provides classification suggestions for a selected column
- **Export**: Export labeled data using the CSV Exporter plugin

### Demo App Structure

| Package                    | Role in Demo App                          |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| @prism/core                | WASM analytics engine, data processing    |
| @prism/plugin-framework    | Plugin loader, manifest management        |
| @prism/plugin-csv-importer | Data ingestion from CSV                   |
| @prism/plugin-observable-charts | Data visualization (charts)           |
| @prism/plugin-openai-llm   | LLM-powered classification suggestions    |
| @prism/plugin-csv-exporter | Export labeled data to CSV                |
